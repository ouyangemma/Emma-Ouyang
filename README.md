# Emma-Ouyang
Hello! My name is Emma Ouyang and I studying Electrical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, expecting to receive a B.S./M.S. degree in 2026.

I am extremely passionate about utilizing  circuitry and signal processing to apply innovative solutions to various industries. I have developed a strong foundation in both hardware, with soldering and PCB design (KiCAD) for data acquisition systems, as well as some work with power management PCBs in Altium. I am also proficient in signal and image processing, with experience in C/C++, MATLAB, Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn) and Java.

As an analytical thinker and team player, I am committed to delivering high-quality results to achieve group goals.

I am eager to connect with others also interested in the hardware and signal processing sectors, and explore new opportunities for growth!
